### What am I looking at?


A place for me to store all the source code for my digital portfolio. 
This is the code that will be compiled and served on [my personal site](https://oliver.bannister.me).

### What is this for? 

This project is to give me a place to showcase my work and also tell people a little about myself.
I also want to use this oppotunity to reenforce my knowlage on the technologies that interest me.

A also want this as a place for potential employers to be able to see under the hood of my personal site.
